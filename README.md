# Guidelines

Whenever a new `master` is deployed, it should be tagged with the new deployed version.
After we reach version 1.0.0 as the first release (production ready). After that, we follow semantic versioning.

## Publishing
Remember to always publish on a merge request. Pipeline `master:only` actions will be created in the future, once we stabilize this library.

Enjoy!
